Research experience
======

- <b>A Sketch-Based Burst Detection Algorithm in High-Speed Data Streams</b>
  - Peking University, Beijing, China, Mar 2020 - Dec 2020
  - Advisor: Dr. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) 
  - Participated in the design of a data structure which supports real-time detection of bursts in high-speed data streams
  - Proposed a sketch-based algorithm that is both memory-efficient, fast, and accurate
  - Drafted and submitted a paper to SIGMOD 2021 as one of the co-first authors

- <b>An Unbiased and Generic Data Structure for Finding Top-K Items in Data Streams</b>
  - Peking University, Beijing, China, Jun 2019 - Feb 2020
  - Advisor: Dr. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) 
  - Participated in a study on devising a data structure called WavingSketch which can provide unbiased and accurate estimations for itemsâ€™ frequencies in a data stream and published the paper in SIGKDD 2020 as the co-first author
  - Proposed the sketch to handle four typical tasks in data stream processing: finding frequent items, finding heavy changes, finding persistent items, and finding Super-Spreaders
  - Made the experiment design and implemented different versions of algorithms in C++
  - Setup the benchmark platform to confirm datasets, algorithms of related work, measures, and re-sampling strategies
  - Ran benchmark with respect to certain performance measures (average relative error, precision, recall, F1 score, and throughput)

- <b>An Automatic SQL-Based Feature Generator for Machine Learning Model</b>
  - Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada, May 2020 - Sep 2020
  - Advisor: Dr. [Jiannan Wang](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/)
  - Devised an algorithm that automatically generates SQL expressions which selects certain information from data tables for the machine learning model
  - Adopting the idea of transfer learning and hyper-parameter tuning for ML
  - Scrutinized and revised Python lib Optuna code and conducted experiments
  - Adjusted the algorithm to reduce the parameters users needed to set and enlarge the search space, making the technique capable of achieving better performance with less effort on fine-tuning
