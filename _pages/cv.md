Work experience
======
* Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Research Intern for Prof. Martial Hebert, June 2019 -- Aug 2019
  * Created a few-shot learning benchmark from ADE20K to imitate realistic conditions of long-tail distribution, multiple information sources
  * Explored representation learning from multiple information sources by multi-task learning and curriculum learning
  * Improved few-shot learning accuracy by 10% to 20% relatively
  * Paper at [Learning Generalizable Representations via Diverse Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12911)
* Vision and Media Computing Group, Peking University, Research Intern for Prof. Shiliang Zhang, June 2018 -- Now
  * Pose Guided Person Image Synthesis
    * Proposed geometric based preprocessing operations to preserve the salient visual details from source images
    * Combined information from multiple source images into a single target using a self-supervised learned
    * Superseded the visual quality of the state-of-the-art on Market-1501 and CUHK-03
  * Unsupervised Feature Learning for Person Re-Identification
    * Leveraged instance-level visual similarity for unsupervised representation learning for Person Re-ID
    * Reduced the amount of required training data for downstream tasks, with only 40% annotation needed during the fine-tuning process
