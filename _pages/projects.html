<h2>BurstSketch: Finding Bursts in Data Streams</h2>

<img src="/images/burstsketch.png" style="float:right;width:500px;" />

Burstis a common pattern in data streams which is characterizedby a sudden increase in terms of arrival rate followed by
a suddendecrease. Burst detection has attracted extensive attention fromthe research community. In this paper, we
propose a novel sketch,namely BurstSketch, to detect bursts accurately in real time. BurstS-ketch first uses the
technique Running Track to select potentialburst items efficiently, and then monitors the potential burst itemsand
capture the key features of burst pattern by a technique calledSnapshotting. Experimental results show that our sketch
achievesa 1.75 times higher recall rate than the strawman solution.

                Top-k Items in Data Streams</a>
</h2>

Finding top-kitems in data streams is a fundamental problem in data stream mining. Existing algorithms that can achieve
unbiased estimation suffer from poor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new sketch, WavingSketch, which is much more
accurate
than existing unbiased algorithms. WavingSketch is generic for it can be applied to four applications:
finding top-k frequentitems, finding top-k heavy changes, finding top-k persistent items,and finding top-k
Super-Spreaders.
We theoretically prove that WavingSketch can provide unbiased estimation, and then give an error bound of our algorithm.
Our experimental results show that,compared with the state-of-the-art, WavingSketch has 4.50 times higher insertion
speed
and up to 9×10^6 times (2×10^4 times in average) lower error rate in finding frequent items when memory size is tight.
For
other applications, WavingSketch can also achieve up to 286 times lower error rate.
