<h2>BurstSketch: Finding Bursts in Data Streams</h2>

<img src="/images/burstsketch.png" style="float:right;width:500px;" />

Burst is a common pattern in data streams which is characterized by a sudden increase in terms of arrival rate followed
by
a sudden decrease. Burst detection has attracted extensive attention from the research community. In this paper, we
propose a novel sketch, namely BurstSketch, to detect bursts accurately in real time. BurstSketch first uses the
technique Running Track to select potential burst items efficiently, and then monitors the potential burst items and
capture the key features of burst pattern by a technique called Snapshotting. Experimental results show that our sketch
achieves a 1.75 times higher recall rate than the strawman solution.

                Top-k Items in Data Streams</a>
</h2>

<img src="/images/struct.png" style="float:right;width:500px;" />

Finding top-kitems in data streams is a fundamental problem in data stream mining. Existing algorithms that can achieve
unbiased estimation suffer from poor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new sketch, WavingSketch, which is much more
accurate
than existing unbiased algorithms. WavingSketch is generic for it can be applied to four applications:
finding top-k frequentitems, finding top-k heavy changes, finding top-k persistent items,and finding top-k
Super-Spreaders.
We theoretically prove that WavingSketch can provide unbiased estimation, and then give an error bound of our algorithm.
Our experimental results show that,compared with the state-of-the-art, WavingSketch has 4.50 times higher insertion
speed
and up to 9×10^6 times (2×10^4 times in average) lower error rate in finding frequent items when memory size is tight.
For
other applications, WavingSketch can also achieve up to 286 times lower error rate.

<h2>PKURanking</h2>

<a href="http://pkuranking.com">PKURanking</a> is a website inspired by <a href="http://csrankings.org">csrankings</a>.
Our motivations are similar: we both aim at helping motivated students find research advisor.
However, we offer more. Apart from ranking, we also provide more fine-grained visualizations on publication and citation
data. What's more, we provide a publication list for every faculty members, so that students can get a whole picture
about their past and recent works. If they are interested in some papers and are willing to delve deeper, they can get
access to these paper directly since we provide URLs. We also integrated a handy search engine supporting structured
queries into our page, making it even easier to extract valuable data from our database.
Currently, we are developing a service that help students build and deploy their academic homepages, and we are
considering to construct a user network to help them establish connections.
And in the future, we will add a section where teachers can release research opportunities.
We want establish PKURanking into a platform where information get efficiently exchanged. We will continuously upgrading
it, and hope that our effort will make some change.
