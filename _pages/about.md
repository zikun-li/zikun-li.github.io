I am Zikun Li, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in computer science in Peking University. My research interest lies widely in the scope of database and networking, and I am also enthusiastic in exploring other fields such as machine learning. 

I am honored to have worked with Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) at Peking University to learn different algorithms in data analysis and networking measurement, and Prof. [Jiannan Wang](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/) at SFU on project SQL-Gen, which aims to devised an algorithm that automatically generates SQL expressions which selects certain information from data tables for the machine learning model.

For the time being, I am applying for graduate school in computer science.

# Research Interest
Because of the diversity of my past projects, I bear wide interest in various topics. I have strong motivation in enabling computer vision systems to <b>Understand Vision from Shape and Semantic Information</b>, which is critical to expanding the effectiveness of computer vision methods. 

Specifically, I have strong interest in three tasks:
* <b>Few-Shot Learning</b>: how to transfer to new domains with few examples?
* <b>Multi-Task Learning</b>: why seemingly related tasks hardly benefit each other?
* <b>Image Synthesis</b>: how to synthesize outputs retaining the details and structure from source images?

# Brief Experience 
During the summer of 2019, I experienced a wonderful period of time at Carnegie Mellon University during my summer research intern for Prof. [Martial Hebert](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/martial-hebert/). We worked on exploring learning better feature representation for few-shot learning. Throughout the process, [Zhiyuan Hu](https://github.com/BinahHu) from Tsinghua University collaborated closely with me, [Yuxiong Wang](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/yuxiong-wang/) and [Pavel Tokmakov](https://pvtokmakov.github.io/home/) offered their valuable guidance on research. The paper is currently on [Learning Generalizable Representations via Diverse Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12911).

Since June 2018, I have worked in Prof. [Shiliang Zhang](https://www.pkuvmc.com/)'s laborotary on computer vision, including a project on unsupervised feature learning and another on image synthesis. The second project is still on-going for refinement and future conference submission (ECCV2020 perhaps).

From November 2018, I have participated in a discussion group on Computer Vision and Machine Learning [Seminar Syllabus](http://tianyuanzhang.com/teaching/2019-fall-dl-pku) initiated along with my fellow peers [Tianyuan Zhang](http://tianyuanzhang.com/) and [Yilun Xu](https://www.yilunxu.com/). This seminar generally requires strong motivation of research in the field of deep learning and contribution in the form of lectures from every participants. So if you are at Peking University right now and already have basic understanding in the very field, do not hesistate to contact us and become a member.
