I am Zikun Li, a fist-year PhD student at Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, and honorably advised by Prof. [Zhihao Jia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/). My research interests are in Quantum Computing Systems, Reinforcement Learning and their intersection.  
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Peking University in 2021. At PKU, I am lucky to have worked with Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) on designing algorithms in data stream mining.
