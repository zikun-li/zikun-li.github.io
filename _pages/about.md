I am Zikun Li, a PhD student majoring in Computer Science. I received my Bachelor's degree at Peking University in 2021. My research interests are in networked systems, data mining, machine learning, systems for quantum computing and their intersection.

I am lucky to have worked with Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) at Peking University to learn and design algorithms in data stream mining. I am also honored to have worked closely with Prof. [Zhihao Jia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/) at CMU on quantum circuit super-optimization and with Prof. [Jiannan Wang](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/) at SFU on the intersection of database and machine learning.

For the time being, I am applying for PhD in Computer Science.
